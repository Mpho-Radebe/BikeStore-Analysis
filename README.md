# BikeStoreSales-Analysis
In this project I created a comprehensive dashboard for a bicycle retail company.
I pulled out the relevant data from the company's database using SQL and then designed a well structured  and dynamic dashboard using MS Excel and Tableau
Used SQL script to generate a detailed dataset that provides me with all the data I need to put together a dynamic sales dashboard. I imported SQL generated dataset into excel and used pivot tables to generate a dynamic dashboard.
Finally, I connected the Excel datasheet that contains SQL generated dataset to Tableau.
The Tableau dashboard can be accessed [Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeStoreDashboard_16794957818650/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
